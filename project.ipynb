    "1. Fixed acidity: The non-volatile acids (like tartaric acid) that don't evaporate easily. It contributes to the overall sourness and structure of the wine.\n",
    "2. Volatile acidity: The amount of acetic acid (vinegar) in the wine. High levels are undesirable and can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar-like taste.\n",
    "3. Citric acid: A small amount of this acid is often added to wines to increase freshness and flavor.\n",
    "4. Residual sugar: The amount of sugar left in the wine after fermentation stops. It can range from dry (low sugar) to sweet (high sugar).\n",
    "5. Chlorides: The amount of salt in the wine. A higher concentration can indicate a salty taste, often due to the water source used in winemaking.\n",
    "6. Free sulfur dioxide: The unbound portion of SO2​ that exists in equilibrium. It acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, helping to preserve the wine's freshness.\n",
    "7. Total sulfur dioxide: The total amount of SO2​ present, both free and bound. It's a key preservative in winemaking.\n",
    "8. Density: The mass per unit volume of the wine, related to the concentration of alcohol and sugar. It's often used to measure the alcohol content.\n",
    "9. pH: A scale from 0 to 14 indicating how acidic or basic the wine is. Lower pH means higher acidity and a more tart taste.\n",
    "10. Sulphates: The concentration of potassium sulphate, which is often added to the wine. It can act as a microbial agent and affects the flavor balance.\n",
    "11. Alcohol: The percentage of ethyl alcohol present in the wine. Higher alcohol content generally contributes to the body and mouthfeel.\n",
    "12. Quality: (Target Variable) The final sensory score, typically rated by human tasters on a scale from 0 to 10 (though the scores in this dataset range from 3 to 8)."
